      <li>Css stands for Cascading Style Sheets</li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Css describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper, or
        in other ,media.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <span style="text-decoration: line-through">Css is not necessaary</span>
        <span style="background-color: yellow;">Css saves a lot of work.</span> It can control the layout
        of multiple webpages all at once.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li class="list_item4">external style sheets are stored in css files</li>
      <br />
    </ol>
    <h2 class="heading">Css can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
    <ul class="list" style="letter-spacing: 6px;">
      <li>Inline-by using the style attribute inside the html elements</li>
      <li>Internal-by using a style element in head section.</li>
      <li>External-by using a link element to link to an external css file</li>
      <li>
        The most common way to add CSS,is to keep the styles in an external CSS
        files. However,<span style="background-color: yellow;">in this tutorial we will use internal and inline
        styles,</span> because this is easier tom demonstrate, and easier to for you to
        try it yourself.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      When comparing CSS class vs ID,the difference is that CSS class applies a
      style to multiple elements.ID on the other hand ,applies a style to a one
      unique element.ID is also special in that case you can use a special URL
      to link directly to an element and it's used bu javascript.
    </p>
    <p>
      in CSS,selectors are used to target a specific element or a range of
      elements in a webpage.Once an elemenent has been targeted,a style or a set
      of styles can be appiled to the element.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a wide range of selectors available.Two of the ,ost commonly used
      are class and ID.Both are used to targeet elements to which a style should
      be applied.
